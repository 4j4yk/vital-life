# vital-life
vital life is a project to introduce the online presence of an offline business which deals in therapy and health field using particular products.

## scope 
vital life did not have technical staff and collaborated with me to accomplish this goal. 

The scope of the project scope is decided over three meetings and few conference calls which took place a few weeks ago. Vital life stakeholders want to display the information online so people can find most of it online before actually visiting the site in person. The data consists of their, vision, mission, products, contact details and testimonies. At as they new to technology and want to build a successful website with all these details, they made the scope very clear in the beginning and wanted to create the site using such technology which scalable regarding adding more information and functionality over time.

## brainstorm session

As we received clear project scope with the client and decided to approach peers who worked on building such scalable product in the past to come up with the decision of development stack, methodology. With this thought, we discussed two model, view controller platform Laravel and Angular to build such scalable website with minimal efforts yet provide an option to further scalability. With the increasing demand in market and adoption of newer frameworks, Angular seems to be a perfect fit for developing need as it based on MVC and functionalities could be implemented using various components without disrupting existing services. 

## decision 
As result of the brainstorming session and in-depth discussion, we are going use Angular MVC framework to build this website. At this point, no database is since most of the content is static. 

## methodology
The client is looking forward to seeing progress as soon as possible and provide feedback on the work going to be done. Considering this Agile approach methodology is best suited for this project.
